    <p>My Second Website :-  E-commerce website was created using vanilla HTML CSS JS. CSS flex-box was used to layout website. Responsive top navigation and a responsive bottom navigation are some features that make this website look good on a range of devices. 
     Other features include dropdown menus(top and side nav),mobile menu, slideshow gallery, image grid, social media buttons, animations, transformationa,transitions etc. JavaScript was used to show/hide dropdown and mobile menus, move thorugh slideshow gallery.
     Overall design is simple & intuitive.Images were taken from internet and this website was designed for educational purposes only.Icons were taken from icons8.com. 
             This website is not for commercial use. Images belong to respective owners. More features will be added to the website in future.</p>
