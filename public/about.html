<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a university graduate in the field of Physical Science and my research area was Computational Chemistry. 
  I am currently based in Singapore and pursuing postgraduate studies. I have a working knowledge of Computer Science and programming, 
  and I am well versed with the use of collaboration tools in both Windows and Ubuntu environments equally.</p>

<p>I have 4+ years of experience working in academia which started with teaching and assessment of university undergraduate students. 
  My role eventually transitioned into research and administration in the Computational 
  Chemistry Center of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka. </p>

<p>I consider myself an excellent team player with good communication skills and ability for multitasking. I have a 
  passion for gaining technical knowledge and using that to solve problems. I strongly believe that I would be a great fit for a fast-paced technology driven organization in search of individuals with 
  not only good skills but also the right mindset to drive innovation.</p>
